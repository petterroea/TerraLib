Idea by a pissed me.

What is this?
----------------

This is an API, which gives you the tools to access most aspects of the saves in Minecraft.

The API has two parts:

* An NBT API
* An Region API


What is NBT?
--------------

NBT stands for Named Binary Tag, and is the file format used by the popular computer game "Minecraft". It is used in anything from server-list to the map contents. 
Read more about it here:

What is the region API?
-----------------------

The region API allows you to open region files and do operations to it, like changing block id's and metadata.
There are also some utilities for this part of the API.

I love it! How can i thank you!
------------------------------
I made this API with the idea of being as public as possible. After all, i know both you and me hate having to put licence notices everywhere, or even change the licence of your WHOLE FUCKING PROJECT just because of one small API. Therefore, this IS public domain! Do what you want to do with it, but please, don't do evil. That is the only rule i put with this API.
You don't have to include that line anywhere. You dont even have to say that i made the API. Just please, don't use it for evil(Unless it is something awesomely evil. In doubt, contact me ;)).

If you want to send me some love, send me a tweet @petterroea, or mail me at petterroea@skymiastudios.com (May change at any time).
Telling people that i wrote the API is also cool.
